- pubsub pulbish to that channel usually events
redis like this
just a place you can publish events and eventually subscribe to those eevents
then you have to cresate resolvers
subscription is a type definition
you have to mkae resolvers for those fields
what events are thye listenign forotherwise dont know what to dontadd any needed authentication and contet
completely different than non subscriptions address, handle thatmake sure you're good to goodotherwise can subscribe to api
authoriation make sure you can set those stuff up
client side setup
react app, review app, you have to add some stuffadd a transport protocol
you have to set it up there
usualyl in application if youre subscribing to something early on in applicationin layout file thats active
maintining the state
kick tht off before anything else happens
otherwise why do you have subscriptions
first thing we have to add query to subscription
subscriptions only interested in sending and modifying eventsdata payload it wants to have access tomatch what subscription is referencing
new item type field with a item typemake this a 
go to type defintions add subscription typefor this example we dont have anything meaningful
set up pub sub protocols
implemnetation is a pubsub protocolinterface you can override and extend with your own, redis but use theirs for forotherwisemake instance of that pubsub equals a new 
subscription events and resolversfor new item field need to make a resovler for itresolvers object, sibling  of queryfor new item
return a function subscribe method
async iterator
new item event like this with same name
and basically the new item subscription is subscribing to any event by the name of new itemand the next part is add the actual trigger when a new item is created
create mutations for when we create an itemcreate item mutation here
theres no root arg
it takes in arguments of atask
return object that representats an item that
pubsub new item trigger tobecause subscriptions only interesting in sending and notifying eventsactual payload when has access to when query inside clientin this case object wthi new item field with item type
subscribing to any event by name itemand the next part we need to do is add the actual trigger when new item is createdcreate mutation for when we create an itemcreate item mutation heretheres no root arg heretakes in argument of task which is string
and what i can do is say return and object that representas an item that ha a task on itpublish to our subscription that has same eventpubsub.publish takes a triggernew item, subscribing to
is create item a mutation that subscribes?
subscriptions must be added to your schema like queries and mutationssetup pubsub protocol server side
create subscription event resolvers
add any needed authentication and context
client side setup
for context its similar to what you'd normally docontext object request 
also somehing called connection
if incoming is a subscription, its a connection property
context cretion a little differntly
going to have sonnectioni context pass that around
handle little differently than non subscription contextjust use subscriptions fieldheres a hook for onconnect
take sa  few, but params or connectionparams
headers
like req.headersitem is
